Description: Implements the geometric statistic (Minimal Enclosing Angle) for quantifying the association between tree-shaped datasets, particularly for cell lineage gene expression data. This method accounts for spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in cell division and differentiation, providing a robust, topology-aware alternative to traditional vector-based correlation measures (e.g., Pearson correlation). Based on the methodology proposed by Mao, Fan, and Hu (2025).
